# NoughtsAndCrosses

After my previous project making my first web application, I thought it was high tim I would make my first Tic-Tac-Toe application. I used my newfound knowledge of algorithms and methods to make the code for Tic-Tac-Toe much more cleaner than that of the web app. I made seperate functions for just about everything, from functions for the commonly used logical operations to functions for updating the board. I consider this project as something that signifies my experience making beginner-level algorithms and combining them to make something more complex and useful.

The next step I took was to make a more complex algorithm - an AI for Tic-Tac-Toe. (Although I didn't actually attempt the AI project until about a year and a half later.)
